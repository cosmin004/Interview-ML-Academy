# Interview ML Academy

You are working in a newly established start-up developing a cutting edge app powered by machine learning and generative AI that helps the wine industryüç∑. In order to grow there are multiple challenges that you should tackle.

## First challenge: Elevator pitch & Presentation preparation

First challenge is to prepare an elevator pitch supported by a powerpoint presentation that will explain the business problem your app is trying to solve. You will meet the board of directors of a Large Corporate customer named *AA Wine Savy Inc.* and you need to impress them in order to select you for a POC (proof of concept).

### Challenge details

**Allocated time for preparation**: 30 minutes

**Presentation time in front of BOD**: 3 minutes

**Deliverables**: explaining the problem, logo, start-up company name, marketing approach

## Second challenge: Machine Learning Model Preparation

Congratulation you have been selected for a POCü•≥! Now you should implement a solution for the presented dataset in this repository using a jupyter notebooks to document your findings regarding data analysis, machine learning models that you try on the problem and test results. You should also use the best performing model to predict results on the test dataset. 

### Wine prices dataset description

alcohol - alcohol level of the wine

category - wine color

country - origin country

description - wine description

designation - title given to the wine(usually based on its quality)

rating - wine score on a scale from 1 to 100

stars - score for the wine on a scale from 1 to 5

price_class - a class describing how expensive the wine is

### Challenge details

**Allocated time for preparation**: 2 hours

**Deliverables**: data analysis, feature engineering, model training and evaluation

You will collaborate with and allocated mentor from the *AA Wine Savy Inc.*

## Third challenge: Presentation and Demo preparation

Now you will soon present again your POC findings to the BOD of *AA Wine Savy Inc.*. Work on preparing a presentation and developing an app for the demo.

**Bonus points**: having a nice GUI, incorporate other features, use text features in your models.

### Challenge details

**Allocated time for preparation**: 1 hour

**Presentation time in front of BOD**: 5 minutes presentation pitch¬†+¬†questions

**Deliverables**: presenting all the development and the POC demo
