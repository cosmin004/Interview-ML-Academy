8120,15.3,Red,US,"Plump, dark strawberry, lavish kirsch, along with cola, cinnamon and allspice show on the nose of this rich bottling from a vineyard on the small appellation's northern end. Vanilla, caramel and cherry-jubilee flavors show on the ripe sip, where a solid tannic tension arises on the finish.",Tierra Alta Vineyard,91,California,Central Coast,Ballard Canyon,Kaena 2015 Tierra Alta Vineyard Grenache (Ballard Canyon),https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/kaena-2015-tierra-alta-vineyard-grenache-ballard-canyon/,Grenache,2015.0,Kaena,4.5
24572,7.0,White,Germany,"Stony, earthy aromas lend a mineral tone to lavish rose and yellow-­cherry notes on this concentrated, yet delicately structured, Riesling. It's intensely sweet and honeyed, with luscious, tropical fruit flavors, yet brisk on the palate, with a streak of citrus acidity.",Abstberg Auslese,92,Mosel,,,Maximin Grünhäuser 2011 Abstberg Auslese Riesling (Mosel),https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/maximin-grunhauser-2011-abstberg-auslese-riesling-mosel/,Riesling,2011.0,Maximin Grünhäuser,4.6
35873,13.5,White,US,"A nice, fruity Sauvignon Blanc, a little sweet and simple, but satisfying nonetheless for its array of ripe pineapple, citrus, lime, green apple and spice flavors, brightened with crisp acidity.",Hanson-Hsieh Vineyard,86,California,Napa,Napa Valley,Maisonry 2010 Hanson-Hsieh Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Napa Valley),https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/maisonry-2010-hanson-hsieh-vineyard-sauvignon-blanc-napa-valley/,Sauvignon Blanc,2010.0,Maisonry,4.3
19723,13.1,Red,US,"This abundantly rich wine seems to melt in the mouth like fine dark chocolate. Aromas emphasize fully ripe plums, black cherries and a whiff of spicy oak. Then chocolaty flavors expand quickly on the tongue as they are carried by copious soft tannins. While big in flavor it's modest in body and alcohol.",,91,California,Central Valley,Lodi,Van Ruiten 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Lodi),https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/van-ruiten-2012-cabernet-sauvignon-central-valley-lodi/,Cabernet Sauvignon,2012.0,Van Ruiten,4.5
14360,13.9,White,US,"This bottling by pioneer Richard Sanford is much more widely available, affordable and stylistically accessible right now than the single vineyard option. It's delicate on the nose with bright lime spritz, Meyer lemon pith, crushed lemon verbena and a grippy brie cheese rind component, then proves tangy on the nuanced palate, with lemongrass and pomelo skin meshing into nectarine and apple flesh.",,92,California,Central Coast,Santa Barbara County,Alma Rosa 2014 Chardonnay (Santa Barbara County),https://www.winemag.com/buying-guide/alma-rosa-2014-chardonnay-santa-barbara-county/,Chardonnay,2014.0,Alma Rosa,4.6
